<!-- 
This code represents my first attempt at using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Initially, I tried solving the problem using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to my lack of understanding of PINNs. However, the neural network failed to learn any meaningful data despite experimenting with various loss functions, optimizers, and other approaches. 

After seeking help from Google, I learned about PINNs and realized they were the correct solution for this problem. I initially wanted to keep all my experimental code to document my thought process, but it was too disorganized and confusing. As a result, I decided to delete the unsuccessful attempts and retain only the working code.

Currently, the code lacks comments because I have been busy and exhausted (it was 3 AM Sydney time when I edited this). I plan to revisit and review this code later, adding comments to make it more understandable. Despite the challenges, I believe I gained valuable insights while solving this problem.
